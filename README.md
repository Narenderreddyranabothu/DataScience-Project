Prediction and Optimization of Energy Usage in Smart Grids
This project is about predicting how much energy will be used in the future by a smart grid (the system that delivers electricity). The idea is to predict when the grid will have high energy demand, so the energy companies can prepare in advance. This helps save energy, reduce waste, and make the grid work better.
I have used past data (how much energy was used before) to train a machine to predict how much energy will be used in the future. This helps us figure out when energy consumption will be high or low.
